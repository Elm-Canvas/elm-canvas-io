# elm-community/canvas benchmarking

## Summary

These are pre-compiled tests to give get performance information on our canvas implementation. Try opening any of these html files in the browser of your choice to get performance information.

## Why are these pre-compiled?

Often, I use [elm-reactor](https://github.com/elm-lang/elm-reactor), but it defaults to using the debug window, which can be a significant hit to performance, because each step may contain various messages which all have to be rendered to complete the update call.

This isn't to discourage you from using elm-reactor, but for good data, make sure you remove the `?debug=true` from the urls that elm-reactor generates.
