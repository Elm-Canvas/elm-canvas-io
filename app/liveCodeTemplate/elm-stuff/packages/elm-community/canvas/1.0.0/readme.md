# Canvas for Elm

Making the canvas API accessible within Elm. The canvas element is a very simple way to render 2D graphics.

# Whats this all this about?

This code ..

``` Elm
import Canvas
import Color


main =
  Canvas.initialize (Canvas.Size 400 300)
  |>Canvas.fill (Color.rgb 23 92 254)
  |>Canvas.toHtml []

-- Canvas.initialize : Size -> Canvas
-- Canvas.fill : Color -> Canvas -> Canvas
-- Canvas.toHtml : List (Attribute a) -> Canvas -> Html a


```

.. renders as ..

The Elm-Canvas library provides the type `Canvas`, which can be passed around, modified, drawn on, pasted, and ultimately passed into `toHtml` where they are rendered.


## What is the Canvas Element?

The canvas element is a unique html element that contains something called image data. The canvas element renders its image data, and by modification of its image data you can change what is rendered. This library provides an API to modify and set canvas image data.

The canvas element itself has three properties: `width`, `height`, and `data`. Confusingly, `width` and `height` are the resolution of the canvas- NOT the actual dimensions of the canvas. To set the width and height of a canvas, one must set the width and height properties in the style of the element. If the styles width and the canvass width are not equal, everything will be fine, the difference being that the pixels will be render as rectangles rather than squares.

The `data` property of the canvas element is the color information in the canvas. The `data` property is an array of numbers. Each number is a color value for a specific pixel. The first four numbers in that array are the red, green, blue, and alpha values of the first pixel, and the next four are the red, green, blue, and alpha values for the second pixel, which is the pixel to the right of the first pixel (and the first pixel is the upper left most one).

``` Elm
  --  A canvas thats three pixels wide and two pixels tall..

  --       |       | 
  --   red | white | red
  --       |       | 
  --  -------------------
  --       |       | 
  --   red | black | black
  --       |       |

  -- ..has the following data..

  getImageData canvas == fromList
    [ 255, 0, 0, 255,    255, 255, 255, 255,    255, 0, 0, 255
    , 255, 0, 0, 255,    0, 0, 0, 255,          0, 0, 0, 0
    ] 

```

Because every pixel is four numbers long, and every canvas has `width * height` pixels, every canvas data has a length of `4 * width * height`.

Because the data is a one dimensional format of a two dimensional arrangement of pixels, to change the pixel at `x=50 y=20` of a `116 x 55` canvas (where `x=0 y=0` is the upper left corner), one must change the values at indices.. 

```
((50 + (20 * 116)) * 4)
((50 + (20 * 116)) * 4) + 1
((50 + (20 * 116)) * 4) + 2
((50 + (20 * 116)) * 4) + 3


((x + (y * width)) * 4) + (colorIndex)
```

## When should you use Canvas?

Think hard before choosing to use the Elm Canvas library! For most use cases, there are probably better tools than Canvas. If you have image assets you want to move around the screen (like in a video game), then [evancz/elm-graphics](https://github.com/evancz/elm-graphics) and [elm-community/webgl](https://github.com/elm-community/webgl) are better options. If you want to render vector graphics use [elm-svg](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/svg/latest). You should use the canvas when you absolutely need to change pixel values in a very low level way, which is an unusual project requirement. Generally speaking, the canvas element should be used when you need to render raster graphics that are not defined until run time. Making a paint app is an example of a project that needs a canvas element, because the purpose of a drawing app is to make graphics that do not yet exist.

## Thanks

Thanks to the authors of the [Elm Web-Gl package](https://github.com/elm-community/webgl) for writing really readable code, which I found very educational on how to make native Elm packages. Thanks to all the helpful and insightful people in the Elm slack channel, including [Alex Spurling](https://github.com/alexspurling), the maker of [this elm app called 'quick draw'](https://github.com/alexspurling).

## How to use elm-community/canvas in your project

elm-community/canvas is a native module, which means you cant install it from package.elm-lang.org. You can still use this module in your project, but it will take a little work. Here is how to do it..

0 Download either this repo, or better yet, one of the tagged releases (like 0.1.0).

1 Copy the content of `./src` into the source directory of your project. So that means copying `./src/Canvas.elm` and `./src/Native/` to the same directory as your `Main.elm` file.

2 Open up `Native/Canvas.js`. The first line says `var _elm_community$canvas$Native_Canvas = function () {`. In your `elm-package.json` file, you have a repo field. In that first line of `Native/Canvas.js`, replace `elm_community` with the user name from the `elm-package.json`s repo, and replace `canvas` with the project name in your repo field. So if your elm package lists `"repository": "https://github.com/ludwig/art-project.git"`, change the first line of `Native/Canvas.js` to `var _ludwig$art_project$Native_Canvas = function () {`.

3 Add the line `"native-modules": true,` to your elm package file.
